## Need Finding ##
The prototypes you designed in previous iterations must have given you some new insight to your design. Use them to help you select your FINAL design.

## Design Alternatives ##
By now you have studied all design principles. Using them and tools previously discussed 
- personas
- scenarios/storyboarding
- etc.
refine your design.

## Prototyping ##
Now you will move towards more mature prototypes for the final design you have selected.

- Wireframes (powerpoint or any other tool)
- physical prototypes 
- Window navigation transition hierarchy

Explain using HCI concepts, the reason for key design features in your interface.

## Evaluation ##
Get the prototypes evaluated by someone in your family or circle get detailed feedback.
