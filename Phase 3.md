## Need Finding ##
The final design which we have selected is design 9 and prototype no 2. 

## Design Alternatives ##
Now we have refined our design more and have changed our prototype a bit with the help of HCI concepts explained in our class. We have now created more screen so the task on each screen is not more than three. we have used more buttons to provide ease to our users and we have use checkboxes at different screens so user donot have to write more. this will save our users time and will help them in providing interactive app. 

## Prototyping ##
Now you will move towards more mature prototypes for the final design you have selected.

- Wireframes (powerpoint or any other tool)
- physical prototypes 
- Window navigation transition hierarchy

Explain using HCI concepts, the reason for key design features in your interface.

## Evaluation ##
Get the prototypes evaluated by someone in your family or circle get detailed feedback.
