## Abstract ##
According to a recent statistical analysis conducted in 2018, more than 40% of the population has no reading or writing skills especially in rural areas of Pakistan. On the contrary, the mobile phone users have grown at a very steep rate even with a stagnant literacy rate. We formed a user-driven approach to research, develop and test a prototype mobile application that could be used to teach illiterates basic reading, writing and counting skills without using traditional schooling techniques.

## Our Mission ##
* Teach people to evaluate and question their sources.
* Making thoughtful cultural and platform decisions.
* Expanding conceptions of Digital world.


## Domain Description ##
The domain at which we will be working is **Educational**. The reason behind selecting this domain is because learning to read and write is expensive and inaccessible to most of the 8 million adult illiterates in Kenya (and 775 million worldwide). WE are creating a mobile platform that will provide universally accessible, affordable and personalized education to illiterate adults. The app is designed for people with zero-low school attendance, and teaches reading and writing lessons through bite-sized exercises.

Digitally literate teachers see technology for all of its creative potential, rather than something they are mandated to do. Digital literacy does not require that teachers become experts, but it does require that they understand the digital tools that can unlock their deeper teaching potential.


## Tasks Performed ##
We saw in class that the actual reason of using a device or interacting with an interface is to accomplish a task. List around 10 tasks that you think users performs in your domain of choosing where good HCI can help people.

1. ###Task 1: Some Name###
Replace this text with what the task is. Some detail what people are actually thinking to accomplish this task. What is the goad, currently how large are the gulf of evaluations and execution

2. ###Task 2: Another  Name###
Replace this text with what the task is. Some detail what people are actually thinking to accomplish this task. What is the goad, currently how large are the gulf of evaluations and execution

##Prospect Technology Use ##
Replace this text with the desription of what technologies you think can be incooperated in the domain you have selected and tasks that you have listed to make the HCI more invisible.

##References##
- Mention and add [links](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), references, books, research papers, code samples, you used to get help in the project.
- Use bullets like this.
- Mention all references. Plagiarism will not be tolerated.
- You see markdown is not that difficult.
- You are CS students not some tom harry from BBA SHE-B-A :-).
- You can and must learn to use markdown and Github. 
- All future project development will be done in something similar to GITHUB
