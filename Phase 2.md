## Task Finalization ##
This purpose of this app is to teach illiterate people with ease so we have selected two tasks related to students:-
#### 1- Student accessibilty to audio and video lectures. ####
As we all know the main purpose of this app is to provide easy and smooth interface for illiterate people so the first and basic need for them is to access lectures. The main task will be of accessing the lecture which was uploaded by teacher. The lecture will be in a form of video and audio. Student will select wheather he/she want to access a particular lecture in a form of video or audio.

#### 2- Student attempting Quiz. ####
The second main task is to evaluate that wheather student is understanding through the lectures provided by the teachers or not so for that there will be assesment in a form of small quizzes. After viewing lectures the student will select quiz option and will select the level of difficulty for his quiz, then he/she can attempt it. 

## Need Finding ##
For the above two task our targeted audeince will be illiterate people. These people will access our app a student and will learn through it by different means which our app will provide.

## Design Alternatives ##

1- In first design the layout of the app makes everything appear on one (or close to) one screen will eliminiate scrolling. However, it makes the sight appear blocky. It would be good to see what people think of the design of this more than anything else. Also, this design doesnâ€™t lend itself well to displaying. Overall it is a good start, but there are other designs to consider.

2- This desgin will be an enhanced or refined version of first design as we will be more seperation between the contents of app. The sight will be be not as blocky as the first one have.

3- This design will add scroll bar at a right side of screen so user can scroll the screen and view the options that cannot be appeared at the top. This will help us not to make our app looks congested for our users.

4-In this design we will drop the idea that we adpoted in design 1, which was of single screen display, In this we will use fixed navigation bar on every screen at the top which will pop different options for our user.

5-This design will be an enhanced version of our design 4 as in this design we have decided not to place a fixed nagivation bar at every screen because it will make our user bored to use the app as it will show the same navigation bar each an everytime at every screen. Now we will use different navigation bars on the screens which have many options.

6-In this design the idea to implement a slider on our screen which will have different options on it that users can perform. This will be more interactive as the slider will continously perform transition.

7-In this design we will drop the idea of navigation bar and slider, We will go for multi screen app. This will be great for our users as by this there will be hardly 2-3 buttons and only 1-2 tasks available at a single screen.

8-This design will be an enchaned version of our previous desgin as in this design we will use multi screens with buttons to navigate from one screen to another. Each task will be perform on a different screen. This will make our app easy to use for rvery user and espeially for illiterate people because if the app would be congested, it will make them confuse.

9- This design will compliment our previous design,In this desgin we use all the features that we mentioned in our previous design with the addition of checkboxes which will help our to type less and will save their time.

## Brainstroming ##
1-As we know this app is also for old people so they want all the options to be visible on the screen.

2-The goal of this is to provide easy education to illiterates. so for that interface should be easy to use.

3-Less tasks should be perform on a single screen.

4-Font must be visible and buttons must be at accurate places.

5- By considering each and every questions we select design 4 and 9 for prototyping as they are quite better than others.
